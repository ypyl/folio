## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The pane keeps its scroll position across saves
The editor pane SHALL preserve the pane's scroll position while the user edits, across the index refresh that follows a save and across any other refresh of the same page. The pane SHALL scroll back to the top only when the open page changes to a different page.

#### Scenario: Saving a scrolled page does not jump to the top
- **WHEN** the user edits near the end of a long page, the pane is scrolled down, and the save completes
- **THEN** the pane stays scrolled to the same position and the cursor remains visible

#### Scenario: Switching pages scrolls the pane to the top
- **WHEN** the user switches to a different page while the pane is scrolled down
- **THEN** the pane scrolls back to the top for the newly opened page
